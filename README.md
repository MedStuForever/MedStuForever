### Hi, I'm TUNAN

- Doctoral-track researcher trainee at **Mei Lab** ([meilab.org](https://meilab.org)), focusing on **Computational Neuroscience** and the **blood–brain barrier (BBB)**.
- Currently completing my undergraduate training at Capital Medical University, Beijing.  
- Interests: neural dynamics & modeling, neurovascular/BBB mechanisms, data-intensive neuroscience.
- I build **code-driven analyses** for single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and image processing.

**Lab focus:**
- **Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)** formation & disorders  
- **Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) / ErbB4** signaling in excitation–inhibition balance  
- **Pathological mechanisms of brain disorders**
